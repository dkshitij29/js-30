## Project 1:
This is a virtual drum kit that can be used on any machine.

***Improvements:***
We can dockerize it and potentially create a PWA using Bubblewrap.

## Project 2:
Real-time clock using JavaScript.

***Improvements:***
We can dockerize it and possibly add numbers to the clock for more informative sessions.
